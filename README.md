# Pathfinding Algorithms

npm run runs the app in development mode. 
After project git clone or fork first intall node_modules by npm install command. 
After command npm start open http://localhost:3000 to view in the browser.

# Algorithms implemented
- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- Astar Algorithm

Note: Shorthest path animation works mutch better in production then on localhost.
